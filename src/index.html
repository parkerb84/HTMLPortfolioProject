    <h3>Learn More About What I Do</h3>
    <p>My goal is to become a Web Application Developer that has all the knowledge needed to create the best websites out there.  The path will be hard and I do have to learn a large amount of programming languages.  I might go into iOS development and also Unity development.  Ultimately I want to make people happy and I believe the best way is to make things work with the least amount of work.</p>
